```{python}
# | label: setup
# | code-fold: true

import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv
import polars as pl
```

grabbed some spam data and moved to `data/spam.csv`.

```{python}
# | label: example
stats = pl.read_csv("data/spam.csv", encoding="latin-1").to_pandas()
stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(stats)

print(stats.datasets[0].features[0].string_stats.rank_histogram)

tfdv.visualize_statistics(stats)
```

whoa - ^ that actually renders out with quarto to html.
I wasn't sure if it would. perhaps not the best medium, but for
something quick - that's amazing.

## Overview

Just jotting down notes. Trying to take advantage of repitition.
Going through the book Machine Learning Production Systems.

## quick intro example

- data wrangling and data cleansing
    - enforcing correct data types
    - valid values
    - eliminating or correcting erroneous data
    - per-feature tranformations
- Normalizing and standardizing
    - 
- Bucketizing
